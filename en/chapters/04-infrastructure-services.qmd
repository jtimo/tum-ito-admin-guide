        subgraph Cluster1["Cluster 1"]
            direction TB
            C1N1["Node 1"]
            C1N2["Node 2"]
            C1N3["Node N"]
        end
        subgraph Cluster2["Cluster 2"]
            direction TB
            C2N1["Node 1"]
            C2N2["Node 2"]
            C2N3["Node N"]
        end
    end

    subgraph Rooms["Physical Rooms"]
        Room1["Server Room 1"]
        Room2["Server Room 2"]
    end

    Cluster1 --> Room1
    Cluster2 --> Room2

        Backup["Daily Backups"]
        Remote["Remote Access"]
    end

```

ITO's ESX infrastructure consists of:

- **Two highly redundant clusters**
- **Distributed across two physical server rooms** (for disaster resilience)
- **Managed via web interface** accessible to authorized administrators

#### Use Cases

VMs are intended for **infrastructure purposes**, not resource-intensive computing:

| Suitable | Not Suitable |
|----------|--------------|
| Web servers | High-performance computing |
| Database servers | Machine learning training |
| Development environments | Data processing clusters |
| Internal tools | Computationally intensive research |

### VM Management

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-cap: "VM Management Capabilities"

    Admin["Administrator"]
    Admin --> WebUI["Web Interface"]

    WebUI --> Start["Start/Stop VM"]
    WebUI --> Console["Remote Console"]
    WebUI --> Config["Configuration"]
    WebUI --> Snap["Snapshots"]
```

Administrators can control VMs through the web interface:

- **Power Control**: Start, stop, restart VMs
- **Remote Desktop**: Access VM console directly
- **Configuration**: Adjust VM settings
- **Snapshots**: Request machine state snapshots

### Backup and Snapshots

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Daily Backups** | Automatic daily backups of all VMs |
| **Snapshots** | Point-in-time snapshots available on request |
| **Retention** | Configurable retention periods |
| **Restore** | Contact ITO for restoration requests |

### Requesting a VM

To request an infrastructure VM:

1. Review your requirements
2. Submit request via ITO Benutzerwiki
3. Specify:
   - Purpose and intended use
   - Required resources (CPU, RAM, storage)
   - Operating system preference
   - Network requirements
4. ITO provisions and notifies administrator

## Hardware Hosting (Colocation)

### Service Description

ITO offers colocation services for chairs and service offices that need to host their own physical hardware:

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-cap: "Hardware Hosting Service"
flowchart TB
    subgraph Customer["Chair/Service Office"]
        HW["Customer Hardware"]
    end

    subgraph ITO["ITO Data Center"]
        subgraph Rack["19-inch Racks"]
            Server["Hosted Server"]
        end
        Network["Network Connectivity"]
        Power["Power Supply"]
        Cooling["Cooling"]
        Physical["Physical Security"]
    end

    HW --> |delivered to| Server
    Server --> Network
    Server --> Power
    Server --> Cooling
    Rack --> Physical
```

## Chair Mail Server

### Overview

Every chair that handles email requires a mail server for receiving messages addressed to chair hosts:

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-cap: "Chair Mail Server Architecture"

    Internet["Internet"]
    Internet --> MX["MX Records"]
    MX --> ChairMail["Chair Mail Server"]

    ChairMail --> Users["User Mailboxes"]
    ChairMail --> Lists["Mailing Lists"]

    Admin["Administrator"]
    Admin --> |manages| ChairMail
```

### Features

- **Email Reception**: All emails to @chair.domain addresses
- **Mailing Lists**: Self-managed mailing lists
- **Administration**: Chair administrators can manage the server
- **Integration**: Works with ITO LDAP for authentication
