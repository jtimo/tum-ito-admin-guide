## User Management

### Requesting New Users

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-cap: "New User Request Process"
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin as Administrator
    participant SDB as StrukturDB
    participant LDAP as LDAP Directory
    participant User as New User

    Admin->>SDB: Submit new user request
    SDB->>SDB: Validate request
    SDB->>LDAP: Create user account
    LDAP-->>SDB: Confirmation
    SDB-->>Admin: Account created notification
    Admin->>User: Communicate credentials
    User->>LDAP: First login
```

To request a new user account:

1. Log in to StrukturDB
2. Navigate to User Management section
3. Fill in required user information:
   - Full name
   - Email address
   - Chair/Department affiliation
   - Required access level
4. Submit the request
5. System processes and creates the account
6. Notify the user of their new credentials

### Managing User Groups

Groups in StrukturDB serve multiple purposes:

| Group Type | Purpose | Example Use |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Access Groups** | Control resource access | Printer access, file shares |
| **Project Groups** | Organize project teams | Research project members |
| **LDAP Groups** | Directory integration | Authentication and authorization |
| **Distribution Groups** | Email distribution | Mailing lists |

#### Creating Groups

1. Navigate to Group Management in StrukturDB
2. Select "Create New Group"
3. Define group properties:
   - Group name (following naming conventions)
   - Description
   - Initial members
   - Group type (LDAP, distribution, etc.)
4. Save and activate the group

### LDAP Integration

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-cap: "LDAP Integration Flow"

    SDB["StrukturDB"]
    SDB --> |sync| LDAP["LDAP Directory"]
    LDAP --> Auth["Authentication<br/>Services"]
    LDAP --> NAS["NAS Access<br/>Control"]
    LDAP --> VM["VM Access<br/>Control"]
    LDAP --> Mail["Mail<br/>Services"]
```

LDAP groups created through StrukturDB are automatically:

- Synchronized with the central LDAP directory
- Available for authentication across ITO services
- Used for access control on NAS, VMs, and other resources

## Host Management

### Registering Devices

Administrators can register and track infrastructure through StrukturDB:

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-cap: "Device Registration Workflow"
flowchart TB
    subgraph Registration["Device Registration"]
        Device["New Device"]
        Device --> Info["Collect Information"]
        Info --> |MAC Address<br/>Device Type<br/>Location| SDB["StrukturDB Entry"]
    end

    subgraph Configuration["Automatic Configuration"]
        SDB --> DNS["DNS Entry"]
        SDB --> DHCP["DHCP Reservation"]
        SDB --> Inventory["Inventory Record"]
    end
```

#### Required Information for Host Registration

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Hostname** | Unique device name | `ws-mueller-01` |
| **MAC Address** | Network interface ID | `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E` |
| **Device Type** | Category | Laptop, Desktop, Printer, Server |
| **Location** | Physical location | Room 01.234, Building MI |
| **Responsible Person** | Primary user/contact | Prof. Dr. Schmidt |

### Infrastructure Inventory

StrukturDB maintains a complete inventory of:

- **Laptops**: Mobile workstations assigned to users
- **Desktops**: Fixed workstations in offices and labs
- **Printers**: Network printers and multifunction devices
- **Servers**: Both virtual and physical servers
- **Network Equipment**: Managed switches and access points

## Mailing Lists and Shared Folders

ITO provides two email collaboration solutions:

### Mailing Lists

Traditional email distribution lists that:

- Forward emails to all list members
- Support moderation options
- Can be managed by list owners
- Are suitable for announcements and discussions

### Shared Folders

Advanced email collaboration that:

- Allows multiple users to send from a common address
- Provides shared inbox functionality
- Supports team email management
- Is ideal for service desks and team communication

### Comparison

| Feature | Mailing List | Shared Folder |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **Receive emails** | All members | All members |
| **Send as shared address** | No | Yes |
| **Shared inbox** | No | Yes |
| **Best for** | Announcements | Team collaboration |
